# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; LE Find Me Profile

The code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple Bluetooth&reg; Immediate Alert Service (IAS)-based Find Me Profile (FMP) using the Infineon PSOC&trade; Edge MCU with AIROC&trade; CYW55513 Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; combo chip and ModusToolbox&trade; software environment.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.
> **Note:** KIT_PSE84_HMI programs all three projects to the external OSPI flash (instead of QSPI).

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 HMI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_HMI) (`KIT_PSE84_HMI`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position for the PSOC™ Edge E84 Evaluation Kit

> **Note:** This hardware setup is not required for KIT_PSE84_AI.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This code example consists of two parts: a locator and a target.

For the locator, download and install the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infineon.airocbluetoothconnect) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/airoc-bluetooth-connect-app/id6443702288) phone.

Scan the following QR codes from your mobile phone to download the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App.

You can also use other Android or iOS apps that support the IAS service.

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

**Note**: The idle power mode configuration in the device configurator is set to CPU Sleep to enable LED blinking, which is controlled by PWMs. You can change the idle power mode to Deep Sleep to allow the device to enter Deep Sleep mode; however, this may affect PWM functionality.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically and initializes Bluetooth&reg; stack and application as shown in **Figure 1**

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/figure1.png)

4. To test using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App, do the following (see the equivalent AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App screenshots in **Figure 2** and **Figure 3**):

   1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; and Location on your Android or iOS device

   2. Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App

   3. USER_LED2 starts blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 120 seconds if a connection has not been established and USER_LED2 will turn off

   4. Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripheral devices. Your device named “Find Me Target” displays in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection. Once the connection is established, USER_LED2 changes from blinking state to always ON state

   5. Select the 'Find Me Profile' from the carousel view

   6. Select an *Alert Level* value on the **Find Me Profile** screen. Observe the state of USER_LED1 on the device; it changes based on the alert level

      **Table 1. User LED1 State based on Alert Level**

      Alert Level | USER_LED1 State
      --------|------------------------
      No Alert    | LED OFF
      Mild Alert | LED BLINK
      High Alert | LED ON

    > **Note:** The KIT_PSE84_HMI features a single RGB LED to display both Bluetooth&reg; connection status and alert level selected on the Find Me Profile screen instead of separate LEDs. You will notice an overlapping LED color in some status.

### Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been implemented in the code example.

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has a configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig) for more details.
